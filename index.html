    <p id="para">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random 
        <br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney <br> College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,<br> from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,<br> discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 <br> and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) <br> by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,<br> very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
